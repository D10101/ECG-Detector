ECG Atrial Fibrillation Detection
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib) from ECG signals. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Overview
Atrial fibrillation is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to serious health complications. This project aims to develop a robust model for identifying AFib from ECG data using various signal processing and machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, ECG_training.csv, contains ECG signals along with their corresponding labels for training and evaluation purposes. Due to data size and security considerations, the dataset is not included directly in this repository.
